				<h1>Surrender Request</h1>
		
				<p>We ask you to consider the following before asking to surrender a dog to us:</p>

				<ul class="contentpage">
					<li>Our foster homes are always full, and we have a waiting list. Even if we can take your dog, we might not be able to do so immediately.</li>
					<li>We are non-profit and all volunteer. Our volunteers spend evenings and weekends contributing to OBG, and have jobs and families. &nbsp;We get 10-20 inquiries per week from owners wanting to give up their dog and we simply can&#39;t respond to every inquiry immediately.</li>
					<li>We are not an animal sanctuary. For example, if you have a 13 + year old dog that is in poor health, it will be very very difficult for us to find a new loving home for your dog. Those are the cold hard facts. With advanced seniors and medical issues we ask that you reconsider - can&#39;t you spend a little more time and help your friend through it&#39;s final years?</li>
					<li>While we have volunteers that perform transport, please do not expect us to drive long distances to pick up your dog.</li>
					<li>We have limited funds and resources. &nbsp;If you have the financial means to provide a surrender fee along with your dog, it would go a long way in helping offset our costs.</li>
					<li>Please be honest with us on the medical condition and temperament of your dog. If your dog is up to date on shots, please bring medical records or a certificate from your vet.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>If you have no choice but to give up your cocker, please do the following:</p>

				<ol class="contentpageorder">
					<li>Fill out and submit our&nbsp;<a href="http://cockerspanielrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form_humanverify?formid=2141">on-line surrender request form</a>. &nbsp; We will contact you as soon as we can, no later than a week from submission.</li>
					<li>As a first step, we prefer to post your dog&#39;s picture and bio as a courtesy listing,&nbsp;where interested adopters can contact you directly. &nbsp;Many dogs get placed this way. &nbsp;A good picture and an informative, honest bio is important.</li>
					<li>If OBG accepts your dog into our program, a volunteer will be in touch to arrange for the transfer. &nbsp;Please try to be flexible; we are all volunteers and many work full time.</li>
					<li>When it is time to turn over your dog, please bring medical records. &nbsp;***Also, you must <a href="http://cockerspanielrescue.rescuegroups.org/info/file?file=15266.pdf">print out the legal surrender form and bring it with you</a>. &nbsp;We will not take him/her without it.***</li>
				</ol>
