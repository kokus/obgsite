				<h1>Adoption Process</h1>

				<div id="programs">
					<div class="box_heading">
						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<span class="line"></span>
					</div>
					<p>The entire adoption process can take from a week to a month, depending on a number of factors including how quickly you find 
						the dog of your dreams, when the dog is medically ready for adoption, how near or far you live from the dog...etc!&nbsp;</p>

					<ol class="contentpageorder">
						<li>Find your perfect match

								<li>Work with one of our Adoption Counselors - email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:adoptinquiry@cockerspanielrescue.com">adoptinquiry@cockerspanielrescue.com</a>&nbsp;to get started.<br>

					<p>OBG takes great pride in our dogs and treat them as we would our own.&nbsp; To that end, we take a holistic approach and attempt to address both their medical and behavioral needs while getting them ready for their foster home. &nbsp;We disclose any medical or behavioral conditions with you prior to the placement of any dog.</p>
					<p>Unless otherwise noted, our&nbsp;dogs have received the following medical treatments:</p>
					<ul class="contentpage">
						<li>Complete vet exam</li>
						<li>Spay/neuter</li>
						<li>Rabies</li>
						<li>DHLPP</li>
						<li>Bordatella</li>
						<li>Urinalysis/fecal</li>
						<li>Senior blood work (9 yrs and over)</li>
						<li>Current on Heartworm and flea/tick preventative</li>
						<li>Any recommended surgical procedures we deem critical for the well-being of the dog</li>

						<h2><a name="Application">About the Adoption Application</a></h2>
						<span class="line"></span>
					</div>
					<p>Our adoption applications are free and non-binding. &nbsp;They are an excellent tool to help us find out more about you and to help 
						you find a perfect match! &nbsp;Once you have settled on a dog and want to move forward with adopting, an OBG Board member will 
						review your application and contact you with any questions. &nbsp;We will also check your landlord and vet references, if applicable.</p>

					<div class="pagelinks"><a href="/info/file?file=15306.pdf">Review/Download Application </a>&nbsp;| &nbsp;<a href="http://cockerspanielrescue.rescuegroups.org/forms/form_humanverify?formid=2401">Submit Online Application</a></div>

						<h2><a name="Homecheck">About the Home Check</a></h2>
						<span class="line"></span>
					</div>
					<p>The purpose of a home visit is to verify your address and make sure the home is a safe and secure environment for one of our 
						dogs &nbsp;As such, our volunteer will need to see any area (inside and outside) that the dog might be going. &nbsp;All family 
						members must be present during the homecheck. &nbsp;It allows us to see how you react to a new dog in the home (we will always 
						try to bring a dog with us). &nbsp;We might be able to point out something you never noticed, such as a gap in fencing, a 
						child&#39;s toy that might make a tempting chew toy for the dog, or even an uncovered trash can that might motivate a cocker 
						to get into mischief. &nbsp;We&#39;re not there to judge your decorating skills! &nbsp;Home checks are valid for one-year.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="programs">
					<div class="box_heading">
						<h2><a name="Contract">About the Adoption Contract</a></h2>
						<span class="line"></span>
					</div>
					<p>Our adoption contract is a binding legal contract that we will walk through with you at the time of adoption. &nbsp;As we do not 
						have a foster-to-adopt program, we instead offer a two week trial period, where you are able to return your selected dog for a full 
						refund of the adoption fee. &nbsp;After that two week period, your dog is considered adopted; but if you can&#39;t keep your dog at 
						any point throughout their life, we will always take them back - in fact, we insist on it!</p>

					<p><em>Highlights of the Adoption Contract:</em></p>

					<ul class="contentpage">
						<li>You agree to take the dog to the vet within one week of adoption.</li>
						<li>The first 14 days are a &quot;trial period&quot; where, if it doesn&#39;t work out for whatever reason, we can work with you to find another dog or return your adoption fee.</li>
						<li>You will provide indoor living conditions, quality food, access to water and the ability for humane means of exercise.</li>
						<li>You will provide timely vet care, keep the dog up-to-date on shots and current on heartworm and flea/tick preventative.</li>
						<li>You will provide a collar and ID tag for the dog, to be worn at all times.</li>
						<li>OBG has provided you with all the information - medical and behavioral - we have on the dog. &nbsp;As such, we are not responsible for future medical or behavioral conditions.</li>
						<li>The dog has a home with OBG for life. &nbsp;If you can&#39;t keep the dog at any time, he or she must be returned to OBG.</li>
