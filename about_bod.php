					<p>These folks work tirelessly (often behind the scenes) to ensure Happy Tails - for both dogs and adopters!  Very few give more of themselves to OBG than this special group of people...</p>

						<h4>Beth Bauer, President</h4>
						<p>Beth has loved cocker spaniels ever since she can remember, so as soon as she could foster, she  joined OBG! She loves learning about  all aspects of the organization and trying new ideas, which eventually led her to become President in 2010. She has chaired Cockers Uncorked, the annual OBG wine tasting and silent auction, since inception. Though she continues to foster in DC for OBG, she has only adopted two (so far), Dasher and Millie!&nbsp;</p>

						<h4>Karen Bryson, VP Intake</h4>
						<p>Karen runs our dog intake and has the heartwarming task of getting to say "yes" and the heartbreaking task of having to say "no".  She and her husband, Brian, perform countless transports from their hom in VA to scoop dogs up from shelters, often at a moment's notice when a dog's life is on the line.  The Brysons are avid fosters, including several special-needs Fanconi dogs, and have adopted many OBG alumni - one of whom is even a therapy dog!</p>

						<h4>Teresa Butler, VP Adoptions</h4>
						<p>Teresa uses years of rescue experience to impart sage advice to fosters and adopters. She fosters countless dogs in VA, including many "honorary" cockers, and has been responsible for more adoptions (including plenty of her own) than we can count. It's obvious that fostering is where her heart is at! She's a regular at our adoption shows accompanied by her mom, June. Teresa is also an incredible legal resource for OBG, working full time in that field.</p>

						<a href="#"><img src="images/content/Deb-(150x150).jpg" alt=""></a>

					<div class="two_thirds column_last">
						<h4>Deb Adler</h4>
						<p>Active with OBG since 2005, Deb started as a transport volunteer and became so much more! She has been part of the intake team, written dog bios and organized several fundraising events. In addition to adopting several OBG dogs, like Rusty, she and her family actively foster and find special needs dogs to be incredibly rewarding fosters. As a former teacher, Deb and her family started a &quot;Cans for Canines&quot; program in their MD community and she would love OBG to reach out to youngsters through a humane education program.</p>

						<h4>Sue Cannon</h4>
						<p>Sue provides a warm welcome as our volunteer coordinator.  We're lucky that hers is the first smiling face many of our new MD volunteers get to see!  Though she's one of the newer members of our board, she brings new energy to the group.  She's also has proven to be incredibly reliable and detail oriented with our dog data.  She dotes on her two human daughters and fur kid, OBG alum Missy!</p>

						<h4>Connie Gay</h4>
						<p>Connie started volunteering with OBG in January 2007 as a foster parent. She is especially fond of the seniors and has fostered a  number of them, including some hospice dogs.  She and her husband adopted several OBG dogs - currently Bruce, Almond and DeeDee. Prior to moving out of the area to NC, Connie was active in overseeing Virginia adoption shows.  She still remains committed to helping cockers in her new neck of the woods, and has continued to provide temp foster and transport to help dogs get to OBG.</p>

					<div class="two_thirds column_last">
						<h4>Cheryl Haralson</h4>
						<p>Cheryl has been active in many aspects of OBG, but she's probably best known for her involvment with all things fundraising. She has raised more funds than we can imagine as   our Shelter Challenge cheerleader, merchandise guru, and event   planner.  In addition, her attention to detail has made her a critical   player in so many things that go on "behind the scenes" - planning, proofreading, organizing - you name it! OBG alums Pepper and Danny are the current fur kids of the Haralson family.</p>

						<h4>CeCe Holman</h4>
						<p>CeCe&nbsp;started volunteering with OBG in 2008 as a school project and before she knew it, she became VA foster coordinator! &nbsp;She enjoys working with both dogs and people, so foster coordination is a natural fit. She and her family have fostered many dogs, but are best known as OBG's go-to for moms and their litters of puppies. &nbsp;She adopted 
						her first OBG dog, Duffy, years ago and has adopted two since: Mitzie and Bo. &nbsp;She also has 2 OBG alum grand-dogs, Bojangles 
						and Patch!</p>

						<h4>Marilyn Kessinger</h4>
						<p>Marilyn keeps the "MD side" of OBG running like a well oiled machine. As foster coordinator, she provides guidance to foster homes 
							in MD and DC, transports, attends plenty of shows and events, and fosters dogs - including current dogs Laddy, Maggie Ann and 
							Fluff whom she adopted to join an earlier adoptee, Luke.  She also helps with our Financials, since she is a retired 
							auditor - it's great to have her on our side!</p>

						<h4>Angela Robinson - Secretary</h4>
						<p>Angela has volunteered with OBG since 2001 and has served on the board for much of that time. Her volunteer 
							activities have included: fostering and successfully placing over 30 dogs; organizing numerous fundraising events; 
							acting as the group’s “face” on multiple media outlets including WUSA’s Petline 9, Fox 5 mid-day news, and the 
							WJZW 105.9 “Spectrum” program.  She also created and continues to operate the OBG’s “Donation Card” program, 
							and assists with the production of OBG’s President’s Letter.</p>

						<h4>Jim Mich - Treasurer</h4>
						<p>Jim might be known for running OBG bake sales, but that's just the tip of the iceburg when it comes to his business acumen. Having just retired from public service, we snatched him up to become OBG's Treasurer where he ensures we manage our funds wisely, qualify to participate in CFC and always receive a seal of approval on our audit. He and his wife, Tracey, are all-around active volunteers and reside in MD with OBG alum, Riley.</p>
