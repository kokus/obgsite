						<h4>Beth Bauer, President</h4>
						<p>A lifelong lover of cocker spaniels, Beth joined OBG as a foster in 2007 when business travel prevented her from adopting a dog of her own. &nbsp;Once OBG&#39;s Dasher came into her life, she decided she couldn&#39;t imagine letting him go! &nbsp;Since that time, her involvement steadily grew and she has fostered over 30 dogs. &nbsp; She has chaired Cockers Uncorked, the annual OBG wine tasting and silent auction, since inception. &nbsp;Beth became President of OBG in 2010. &nbsp;Beth works full-time as a financial systems consultant and lives in DC with her boyfriend, Jorge, and their little black cocker, Dasher!</p>

						<h4>Karen Bryson, VP Intake</h4>
						<p>Karen runs our dog intake and has the heartwarming task of getting to say "yes" and the heartbreaking task of having to say "no".  She and her husband, Brian, perform countless transports to scoop dogs up from shelters, often at a moment's notice when a dog's life is on the line.  The Brysons are avid fosters, including several special-needs Fanconi dogs, and have adopted many OBG alumni - one of whom is even a therapy dog!</p>

						<h4>Deb Adler</h4>
						<p>Active with OBG since 2005, Deb started as a transport volunteer - but she didn't stop there! Since then, she has been part of the intake team, written dog bios and organized several fundraising events.  Along with her family, she has fostered approximately 25 cockers, working with dogs that have anxiety or medical issues. She has a special interest in working with dogs that have special needs such as epilepsy or blindness. Deb and her family started a "Cans for Canines" aluminum can recycling program in their community. As a former elementary school teacher, she would love to see OBG reach out to youngsters through a humane education program. She lives in MD with her husband, Jeff and son, Blaine, as well as OBG alum,  Rusty.</p>

						<h4>Sue Cannon</h4>
						<p>Sue provides a warm welcome as our volunteer coordinator.  We're lucky that hers is the first smiling face many of our new volunteer get to see!  Though she's one of the newer members of our board, she brings new energy to the group.  She's also has proven to be incredibly reliable and detail oriented with our dog data.  She dotes on her two human daughters and fur kid, OBG alum Missy!</p>

						<h4>Connie Gay</h4>
						<p>Connie started volunteering with OBG in January 2007 as a foster parent. She is especially fond of the seniors and has fostered a fair number of them, including some needing hospice and comfort care.  Other fosters ended up staying put - Connie's three dogs, "Air" Bruce, Almond and DeeDee are lovingly referred to as "failed fosters" because she and her husband couldn't bear to part with them! Prior to moving out of the area, Connie was active in overseeing Virginia adoption shows.  She still remains committed to cockers - especially the seniors - in her new neck of the woods, and has continued to provide temp foster and transport for dogs to help them get to OBG.</p>

						grew. &nbsp;Since then she has fostered many litters of moms and their puppies and she&nbsp; took over as VA foster coordinator in 
						August of 2008! &nbsp;As VA foster coordinator, she enjoys working with the dogs and their foster families. She has been on the 
						OBG Board for many years and enjoys working with the dogs and prospective adopters in finding their forever homes. &nbsp;She adopted 
						her first OBG dog, Duffy, 9 years ago and has adopted two since: Mitzie and Bo. &nbsp;She also has 2 OBG alum grand-dogs, Bojangles

							in MD and DC, transports, attends plenty of shows and events, and fosters dogs - including current dogs Laddy, Maggie Ann and 
							Fluff whom she adopted to join her original adoptee, Luke.  She also helps with our Financials, since she is a retired 
							auditor - it's great to have her on our side!</p>
